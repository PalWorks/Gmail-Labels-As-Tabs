# Future Roadmap & Ideas

## UI/UX Improvements
1. **Fixed Width Buttons**: 
   - The current expanding buttons (showing edit/close/move on hover) cause Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).
   - **Proposal**: Switch to fixed-width buttons with a dropdown arrow for actions to improve stability and user experience.

2. **Show Unread Count in the default Inbox & Sent labels too**:
   - Add unread count to Inbox & Sent labels too.

## Uninstall Experience
2. **Backup Prompt**:
   - When the extension is uninstalled/removed, show a popup asking: "Do you want to backup your tab details, so that you can quickly use them again when you reinstall?"

3. **Multi-Account Backup Support**:
   - For the uninstallation popup, design a solution to handle multiple logged-in Gmail accounts within the same browser profile.
   - Ensure tab details for *all* active accounts can be backed up or handled appropriately.
